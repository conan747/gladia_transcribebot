# Gladia Transcribe Bot

This is a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) to transcribe voice messages automatically.

It uses the [Gladia](https://gladia.io/) api which offers a free tier to transcribe up to 10 hours/month. This should be more than enough for your incoming voice messages.

Get yourself a Gladia API key and set it in the configuration.


## Rationale

I hate when I receive a voice message. It's really inconvenient to listen to it and there's no quick glance function. Having the transcript is much easier.
